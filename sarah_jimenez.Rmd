## Bio

Sarah works with Community Labor United in Boston as the lead researcher for the Care That Works coalition.

As a movement research generalist, Sarah has supported campaigns concerning wage and hour violations; public transportation fare structures; commercial short-term rentals; community-controlled microgrids; child care for nonstandard schedules; child care-supportive zoning ordinances; and statewide universal child care. She is still waiting for an opportunity to support a long-term, grassroots-driven action research project. 

Sarah is also interested in the strategies and practices of solidarity economy, evaluation, contemplative traditions, and storytelling.
